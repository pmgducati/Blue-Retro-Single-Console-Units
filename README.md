# Blue-Retro-Single-Console-Units

This is a collection of PCBs that I made to work with darthcloud's BlueRetro Project. (https://github.com/darthcloud/BlueRetro) The PCB's were created in Eagle and I have included the Gerbers if you would like to create them yourself.

Currently I have NES, Nintendo 64, Gamecube, Sega Saturn, 3DO, PSX/PS2 and PCEngine/Turbografx 16 complete.

I have created PCB's for other supported systems (Listed Below) but have not tested them as I do not have the sytems. I have created a issue for each of the systems that I do not have to test. If you make one please comment in the related issue on any progress/problems.

I am working through Virtual Boy but need to find a cost efficient way to connect it to the Virtual Boy as I am not consolizing mine.

Here is the current status of all systems:
